=== JAESON

A very simple json parser.

Mostly built for learning and tinkering purposes. 
Uses pattern matching from the https://github.com/gvergnaud/ts-pattern[ts-pattern]
library. Thank you for such a cool library. Uses command line argument parsing from 
https://github.com/stuartcarnie/docopt.coffee[docopt] library. It really put a https://www.npmjs.com/package/docopt#docopt--a-command-line-option-parser-that-will-make-you-smile[smile]
on my face after using it.

This project was done thanks to the challenge (Coding Challeneges) by John Crickett.


To run:

`npm run build && npm run start` after doing `npm i`. After that you can call do `node build/src/main.js --help`
to view the manual.
