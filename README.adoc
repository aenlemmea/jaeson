=== JAESON

A very simple json parser.

Mostly built for learning and tinkering purposes. 
Uses pattern matching from the https://github.com/gvergnaud/ts-pattern[ts-pattern]
library. Thank you for such a cool library. 

This project was done thanks to the challenge (Coding Challeneges) by John Crickett.

-----

To run:

`npm run build && npm run start` after installing the dependencies `typescript` global, and `ts-pattern`.
